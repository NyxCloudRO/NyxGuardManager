## What is a NyxGuard Proxy Host?

A NyxGuard Proxy Host is the secure public entry point for an internal app or service.

It connects your domain to a target upstream, applies TLS (SSL), and routes traffic through NyxGuard controls.

### What it includes

- Domain-to-service forwarding (reverse proxy).
- SSL certificate assignment and HTTPS enforcement.
- Layered security options such as access control and threat protection.
- Visibility in NyxGuard so you can manage, audit, and update exposure safely.

### Typical use

Use a NyxGuard Proxy Host when an app runs on a private IP and port, but you want secure public access through a domain.
